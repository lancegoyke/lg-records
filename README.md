Compete with others and climb to the top of the leaderboard! 🚀

I wrote this Django app to store metabolic workouts and keep track of how my clients were performing.

I managed to keep it simple:

1. Sign up for an account
2. View a workout in plain text
3. Time how long it takes you to perform
4. Upload your score

The backend then shows the top score, and, more importantly, *your* top score. That way you can keep track of what you've done in the past.

It's been surprisingly useful! You're welcome to use it!

[Living Room Glacier (Level 4)](https://record.lancegoyke.com/challenges/living-room-glacier-l4) is probably the hardest one! 😁
