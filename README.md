Compete with others and climb to the top of the leaderboard! üöÄ

I wrote this Django app to store metabolic workouts and keep track of how my clients were performing.

## User Flow

1. Sign up for an account
2. View a workout in plain text
3. Time how long it takes you to perform
4. Upload your score

The backend then shows the top score, and, more importantly, _your_ top score. That way you can keep track of what you've done in the past.

It's been surprisingly useful! You're welcome to use it!

## Local Development

### TODO: Below Section is Outdated

First, set up environment variables:

```bash
cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
# then replace the values with working values
```

To spin up Django development server:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

To spin down development server:

```bash
docker compose down
```

The database will need to be set up as well:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

To create an admin user:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

To login to the Django admin, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/backside/

Some functionality won't work unless you update the sites model at http://127.0.0.1:8000/backside/sites/site/1/change/

If you ever add or update the Django models, you'll need to instruct Django to update the database with migrations:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py makemigrations
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Adding JavaScript or TypeScript

The `build.js` file is used to build the TypeScript files. Bun bundles the files.

The bundler searches for files in the `src` directory which end in `index.ts`.

It builds them into the `build` directory which is listed in the Django settings file as a static files directory.

To create a new file for a Django template:

1. Create the new `index.ts` inside the `src` directory corresponding to the Django template, e.g., `src/app/template/index.ts`
2. Build the file into the `build` directory with `bun build-js`
3. Import the built file into your Django template, e.g., `<script type="module" src="{% static 'app/template/index.js' %}">`

## Deploying for Production

This project is deployed on Heroku, but not configured to automatically deploy on pushes to GitHub. Instead, push directly to Heroku:

```bash
# authenticate Heroku CLI
heroku login
# set `heroku` as a remote repository
heroku git:remote -a lg-records
# push directly to Heroku
git push heroku master
```

The `heroku.yml` file runs two commands in the release phase:

```bash
python manage.py migrate  # untested
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

If you need to run commands on the production server, check out `heroku run` from the Heroku CLI.
